This is a replica of the basket page from the deliveroo website.
Its working with an http request to a back end I developed using `axios` package.

Just run `yarn` in your console to install all dependencies and `yarn start` to launch.

## Features

- Click on an item to put it in th basket.

- You can click multiple times if you need to purchase more than one item.

- You can add or remove unity of an item already choosen in the basket using plus and minus button.

- The counter goes minimum to 1 if you try to go under it will remove the item from the basket.
